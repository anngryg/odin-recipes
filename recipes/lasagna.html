                Tender sheets of pasta, a creamy ricotta cheese filling, and a rich meaty tomato sauce are all topped with more cheese and baked until browned and bubbly.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Lasagna Noodles: This recipe uses regular (not no boil) lasagna noodles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Onion: Adds flavor to the sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ground Beef: My go-to for a lasagna meat sauce. If desired, you can add 1/2 pound of Italian sausage along with the ground beef. The Italian sausage will add even more flavor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Garlic: You can’t beat the flavor of fresh garlic!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Marinara Sauce: You’ll need 48 ounces (two 24-ounce jars) of store-bought sauce. If you want to use homemade marinara sauce, you’ll need 6 cups of sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fresh Parsley: Brightens up the flavors; you can omit it if you don’t have any on hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Egg: Helps to bind the ricotta cheese, which thickens it and prevents it from getting soupy as it bakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ricotta Cheese: Adds creaminess and cheesy flavor. If you don’t care for ricotta, you can omit the ricotta and egg from the recipe. You can also substitute cottage cheese if needed and omit the egg.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mozzarella Cheese: A classic ingredient in traditional lasagna, the mozzarella melts wonderfully as it bakes. Look for a ball of part skim or whole milk mozzarella, not fresh mozzarella.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Parmesan Cheese: Brings more bold cheesy flavor.
                </li>
            </ul>
